# Open Brain Memory Protocol

Before starting any non-trivial task, check Open Brain for relevant context when the Open Brain MCP tools are available.

- Use `search_thoughts` or `search` with a concise query covering the project, repo, tool, person, or decision involved.
- Treat Open Brain results as context, not absolute truth. Prefer explicit user instructions, current repository files, and live tool output when they conflict.
- Do not rely on memory for facts that are easy and important to verify from the current workspace.
- If Open Brain tools are unavailable, continue the task and mention that no Open Brain recall occurred when it matters.

At the end of meaningful work, consider writing compact operational memory with `capture_thought` when the session produced durable decisions, user preferences, reusable repo lessons, unresolved blockers, or concrete next steps.

- Search first to avoid obvious duplicate captures.
- Capture only self-contained summaries with provenance such as repo, file, date, task, or session context.
- Do not capture secrets, credentials, raw logs, large code blocks, private customer data, PHI, or low-value transcript noise.

# nix-darwin Activation

Do not try to apply nix-darwin changes from this environment. Activation requires sudo, so make configuration edits and run non-activating verification where possible, but leave commands such as `darwin-rebuild switch` for the user to run manually.
